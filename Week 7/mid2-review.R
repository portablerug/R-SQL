# Midterm Review

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Distributions
## Binomial
# SYNTAX: dbinom(x , size, prob)
# x = successes, size = number of trials
#  - When interested in prob that an event will occur x times out of n trials

# Ex: toss coin 10 times, find prob of getting 5 heads
dbinom(x = 5, size=10, prob=.5) # P(X = 5)

# Ex: toss coin 10 times, find prob of getting 4 of fewer heads
x <- dbinom(0:4, size=10, prob=0.5)
sum(x) # P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4)

pbinom(4, size=10, prob=0.5) # P(X â‰¤ 4)

# ------
## Poisson 
# SYNTAX: dpois(x, lambda): 
# - counts how many times a random event occurred in an interval of time
# lower.tail: If TRUE (default) probabilities are P(X < = x), if FALSE then P(X > x)

# A small store receives on average 4 customers per hour. Assume the number of customers
# per hour follows a Poisson distribution with LAMBDA = 4

# What is the prob that EXACTLY 3 customers arrive in an hour? 
dpois(3, lambda=4) ## P(X = 3)

# What is the prob that 3 OR FEWER customers arrive? 
ppois(3, lambda=4) ## P(X <= 3)

# What is the prob that MORE THAN 3 customer arrive?
ppois(3, lambda=4, lower.tail=FALSE) ## P(X > 3)
1-ppois(3, 6) #????

# What is the smallest number of customers such that the probability of seeing THAT MANY
# OR FEWER is AT LEAST 90%
qpois(0.90, lambda=4) ## output: 7 -> P(X <= 7)

# Simulate the number of customers in 10 DIFFERENT HOURS
rpois(10, lambda=4)

# ------
## Uniform
# SYNTAX: dunif(x, min= , max= , log=FALSE)
# log=F logical. if T, probs are returned as log(p)
# SYNTAX: punif(q, min= , max= , lower.tail= T, log.p=F)
# lower.tail: logical, if T (default), probs are calculated P(X <= x), if F, P(X > x)

# Let X ~ UNIF(0, 10)
# what is the density at x = 4?
dunif(4, min=0, max=10)

# What is the prob that X <= 4?
punif(4, min=0, max=10)
# X > 4 ? 
punif(4, min=0, max=10, lower.tail=FALSE)

# What value cuts off the lowest 75% of the distribution?
qunif(0.75, min=0, max=10)

# Simulate 5 random values from a Uniform(0,10)
runif(5, min=0, max=10)

# ------
# Exponential
# SYNTAX: (x, rate= )
#  - time until the first event 

# Let Y ~ Exp(LAMBDA = 2), so mean = 1/LAMBDA = 0.5
# What is the density at x=1?
dexp(1, rate=2)

# What is P(Y <= 1)
pexp(1, rate=2)
# what is P(Y > 1)
pexp(1, rate=2, lower.tail=F)

# What value of y gives the CUM PROB 0.9?
qexp(0.9, rate=2)

# ------
## Normal
# SYNTAX: (x, mean, SD)
#  - models time it takes to complete a task (predicts time until firs success)
# Suppose the height of adult women is normally distributed with a mean of 64 inches
# and SD of 3 inches

# What is the height denstiy at EXACTLY 66 inches
dnorm(66, mean=64, sd=3)

# What is the prob that a woman is SHORTER THAN 66 inches?
pnorm(66, mean=64, sd=3)
# what is the prob she is TALLER THAN 66 inches
pnorm(66, mean=64, sd=3, lower.tail=FALSE)

# What height marks the 90th percentile?
qnorm(0.90, mean=64, sd=3)

# Simulate the heights of 5 women
rnorm(5, mean=64,sd=3)

}

# ifelse(test expression, yes, no)

### for 
#  - repeats code for a FIXED number of times
for(i in 1:5){
  print(i)
}
# Nested FOR loop
x <- matrix(1:6, 2,3)
for(i in seq_len(nrow(x))){
  for(j in seq_len(ncol(x))){

### while
#  - repeats code while a condition is true
y <- 1
while(y <= 5){
  print(y)
  y <- y+1
}

### repeat
#  - repeats code indefinitely until a break is encountered
x <- 1
repeat{
  print(x)
  x <- x + 1
  if(x > 5){
    break
  }
}

### %in% 
#  - logical operator, Used to determine if an element belongs to an R object
x <- c("hello")
if("hello" %in% x){
  print("hello is in the vector")
}else{
  print("it is not in the vector")

  }
}
# invoke function with argument 'a'
squares(4)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Probability Rules
# 1) P(A) is a number between 0 and 1
# 2) probs must sum to 1
# 3) for mutually exclusive events
#    - P(A or(U) B) = P(A)+P(B)
#    - P(A and B) = 0
# 4) An event can either occur or not
# 5) Overlapping events
#   - P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
# 6) Independent events
#   - P(A and B) = P(B)P(A) ; A and B cannot be mutually exclusive and independent

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Levels of Measurements
# Nominal => frequency tables, bar charts
#  - NOT {ordered, numeric, true zero} ; Ex: bloodtype, color
# Ordinal => medians, rank-based tests
#  - NOT{numeric, true zero} ; IS{ordered} Ex: rating
# Interval/Ratio => mean, SD, t-tests, histograms, scatterplots
#  - IS{ordered, numeric}; interval is not true zero.
#. - Interval ex: temperature. Ratio ex: weight, distance, age

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### SQL
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Integrity Rules
# Entity Integrity
# i) that the primary key for each relation is unique
# ii) that the primary key values are unique and not NULL for each attribute(column)
# ensures there are no duplicate tuples in a given relation

# Referential Integrity
# constraint involving two relations(tables)
# requires all foreign keys to be either NULL or correspond to a primary key value
# ensures that cross-references to non-existing tuples cannot occur

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Keys
# Super keys
#  - set of one or more attributes that uniquely identify a tuple inna relation

# Candidate keys
#  - selected from the set of SUPER KEYS, should not have redundant attributes

# Primary Key
#  - uniquely identifies any tuple in a gien relation
#  - Can only be 1 primary key chosen from CANDIDATE KEYS 

# Foreign Key
#  - An attribute or set of attributes which match PRIMARY KEY attributes
#  - in another relation
#  - should point to the Primary Key


# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Schema
# - relation consists of the relation name and the names of its attributes
# Ex: 
#  - Product(PName, Price, Category, Manufacturer) 
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
#  - commands used to interact with data itself
dbGetQuery(mydb, "SELECT * from EMPLOYEE") # retrieve all data from a table

# Select all attributes from mtcars but return only first 5 tuples
dbGetQuery(mydb, 'select * from mtcars LIMIT 5')

# select 'wt' and 'mpg' for cars with mpg > 30
dbGetQuery(mydb, 'select wt, mpg from mtcars WHERE mpg > 30')

# Find the number of cylinders cars in the survey have (DO NOT RETURN DUPLICATES)
dbGetQuery(mydb, 'select DISTINCT cyl from mtcars')

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### select average
avg () # 1 vector per avg function

### lapply & sapply

#  - data.frame ()
#  - rep()
#  - length()
# ------

# Name the following in both tables. Only allowed to check out once
# Super Keys
#  - check.out : {name, date, isbn} #need to tell me what the {MISSING} column is
#             {name, isbn}
#             {}

#  - book.info : {title, isbn, genre}
#                {title, isbn} ; can you match to one UNIQUE item
#                {isbn, genre}
#                {title, genre}
#                title} ; {genre}
# if you were given a genre, can you match to ONE title and ISBN
# Needs to uniquely identify a ROW


# Candidate Keys: choose from Super Key
#  - book.info : {title} , {isbn}
#  - check.out : {name , isbn}

# Primary Key
#  - check.out :
#  - book.info : {isbn}

# Foreign Key
#  - check.out : {isbn}
#  - book.info : 


# 5) Write a schema for BOOK_INFO
#   - {title, isbn, genre}

# 6) Define a suitable domain for GENRE in BOOK_INFO (at least 6 items)
#   - ...adventure, fiction, sci-fi... 

# 7) Suppose the tuple <James, NULL, FF-33>, is added. What integrity rule is violated?
#   - ref
