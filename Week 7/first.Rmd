## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
pbinom(3, size=10, prob=0.5)

```
If there are12 cars crossing a bridge per minute on average. what is the prob of having 17 cars pass
```{r}
ppois(16, lambda=12, lower=F)
```

deck <- 
ttl_cards <- lenght(deck)
spades <- lenght(deck[deck == "Spades"])
